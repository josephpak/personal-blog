> “Looks like you have a lot of great experiences but I have to honest, you come off as scatterbrained.”

These words could not have been more brutally honest. For months, I had been looking for an opportunity to dive into the world of tech and for months, I had been unsuccessfully trying to convince recruiters and heads of departments that I was a valuable addition to any team in any nontechnical role.



After I heard these words resonate in my head, I began to think about my journey thus far, my hopes and aspirations, and the steps I needed to take in order to achieve the goals I had set for myself. During the process of introspection, I realized that the source of my problems originated from a deep, innate tendency to be curious. This curiosity has led me to consider many different worlds and think about many different types of problems that need to be solved. I have never been happy accepting that things are a certain way because they have always been that way and I constantly ask questions of “What if?” and “Why?”. In a way, that has been a blessing and curse — from one viewpoint, I am open minded and proactive about finding the right career and life opportunities, and from another viewpoint I am directionless, and scatterbrained.



It’s extremely difficult feeling directionless as an Ivy League grad. Sometimes, I wish that I was as resolute and calculated as many of my fellow graduates of the Class of 2014. It was commonplace for some freshman and sophomores to seek out opportunities in finance and consulting during their summer vacations. Others worked in research positions with famous faculty, sequencing DNA and taking care of mice for experiments. By the time I had figured out what investment bankers did and what BCG and McKinsey were, it was too late — summer internships had been converted to full-time offers and I was left to frantically figure out how to earn a paycheck after I graduated in order to become financially independent. I was extremely lucky to find a position through the on-campus career services program at a firm in Boston and I remember thinking to myself that I would finally have direction and peace of mind.



Finding a job right out of college generating data-driven insights and Fortune 500 clients at a small, hard-working financial services consultancy was a true blessing for me. I had the chance to live with my college roommates, create friendships at work that I know will last a lifetime, and become financially sufficient. I will never forget how helpful and patient everyone was when I first started, the company outings, and lunches with the analysts.



In a world of direction and routine, I slowly started to become unhappy. I was still very curious about many different ideas, products, and problems — particularly in tech. I would scour the Internet for blogs and articles posted by experts in the field on fintech, block chain technology, and artificial intelligence. I would promote and evangelize services that ended up becoming unicorns in the ilk of Slack, Instacart, and Lyft. I finally realized that financial services was not for me and that I did not enjoy peering into Excel workbooks day after day, churning out reports that required little critical thinking and even less creativity. I dreamed and I was curious.



The thing that got the ball really rolling for me was reading Ruben Harris’ story Breaking Into Startups. I realised then that I didn’t have to accept that my life had to be a certain way, that I could question and be proactive about pursuing the things that interested me and drove me. I created a rough outline of my 5 and 10-year goals and I realized that I needed to take action in order to get anywhere.



## My Goals

1-year: Break into startups, technology using my previous experiences and strengths to provide value in any way that I can. Find a mentor(s) that will be able to help me transition and think critically about my career path.



5-year: Get into/ graduate from Hack Reactor/ App Academy / Dev Bootcamp in order to cement my interest and skills in programming.



10-year: Create/ work on products/ideas that will make a difference.



## The Problem

It has been very difficult conveying how my prior experiences are helpful or useful to specific roles at companies. Truth be told, my strength is that I am a human swiss-army knife — flexible to many different roles and responsibilities, but that is a tough selling point for many recruiters.



In order to resolve this gap in between my goals and the core problem where I seem scatterbrained, I decided to outline my strengths and bring more clarity to how these make me a great teammate and someone that is focused and determined.



## My Strengths

Team-Building: I highly enjoy building teams. I have built teams in high school and in college in various roles and found that I am thorough at recruiting, training, and retaining talent.



**Empathy**: I am highly empathetic. I am a great listener and I am always sure to be cognizant of the specific situations of every single person on teams that I work on. I have a great sense of what people need emotionally and professionally and I am always there to help.



**Resilient**: I don’t give up. I get rejected, refused, turned away but I will never give up on myself and my team.



**Passionate**: I am very passionate about the things that I build and create. This enables me to work very hard and push others around me to be great. I am hungry and innately driven.



**Patient**: When things don’t go my way, I am very patient. When I’ve had team members who have struggled, I think about the times that I have struggled and how patient others were around me. It takes a certain amount of empathy as well to be patient.



**Proactive**: I make sure that I am constantly asking questions about the things that I work. I appreciate when people give me structure and advice but I am also able to create processes and structure for myself. I don’t wait for others to act, I make sure that I am always reevaluating and looking to the next step.



**Organized**: I keep inbox zero. My calendar is color-coded.



It took me a while to accept, but I think that my curiosity and predilection for the unknown is what keeps me happy and on the way to fulfilling my goals. I have hope that sometime soon I will be able to find a home for my many interests and strengths working with a team to create something meaningful and interesting. Until then, I will continue to dream big but work to structure my past experiences and thoughts into a more approachable manner. I find it hard to believe that history’s disruptors and innovators envisioned a one-track journey to achieving greatness. I’ll leave you with a quote that I think about a lot.



> “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”

For all the scatterbrained college graduates out there — I hope that you find success in what you are passionate about and never cease to question, never cease to stay hungry and foolish.
